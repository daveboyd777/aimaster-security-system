- Pull requests are opened (testing and validation)
- Daily at 2 AM UTC (dependency checks)
- Tagged commits to main branch (release creation)

### Repository Labels Setup

GitHub Actions will create these labels automatically:
- `bug`, `enhancement`, `security`, `critical`
- `needs-triage`, `needs-immediate-attention`  
- `community-reported`, `community-request`
- `dependencies`, `maintenance`, `automated`

## üë• Community Management

### Contributor Access Levels

The system is designed to automatically grant privileges based on contribution:

#### **Automated Privilege Escalation**
1. **New Contributors**: Can create issues and PRs
2. **Regular Contributors** (5+ merged PRs): Triage access via automation
3. **Core Contributors** (20+ merged PRs): Review privileges
4. **Maintainers**: Manual assignment for repository management

#### **Manual Setup for Core Team**
```bash
# To grant specific users enhanced access:
# 1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Manage access
# 2. Click "Invite a collaborator"  
# 3. Set appropriate permission level:
#    - Read: Basic access
#    - Triage: Issue/PR management
#    - Write: Direct commits (use sparingly)
#    - Maintain: Release management
#    - Admin: Full repository control
```
