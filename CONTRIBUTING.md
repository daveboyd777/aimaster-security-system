# Contributing to AIMaster Security System

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AIMaster Security System! This project was originally generated by Warp AI and welcomes community contributions to improve and extend its capabilities.

## üöÄ About This Project

**Important Attribution:** This security system was generated and developed using Warp AI (https://warp.dev). The initial architecture, implementation, and documentation represent a collaborative effort between human requirements and AI-assisted development.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Getting Started
1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally
3. **Create a feature branch** from `develop`
4. **Make your changes** following our guidelines
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Types of Contributions We Welcome
- üêõ **Bug fixes** - Help us identify and fix issues
- ‚ú® **New features** - Extend the security framework capabilities
- üìö **Documentation** - Improve guides, examples, and API docs
- üîí **Security improvements** - Enhance the security posture
- üß™ **Tests** - Add test coverage and improve validation
- üåê **Platform support** - Expand cross-platform compatibility

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Prerequisites
- **PowerShell 7.0+** installed
- **Git** for version control
- **Code editor** with PowerShell support (VS Code recommended)

### Code Standards

#### PowerShell Best Practices
```powershell
# Use approved verbs
function Get-SecurityStatus { }  # ‚úÖ Good
function Fetch-SecurityStatus { }  # ‚ùå Avoid

# Use PascalCase for functions and parameters
function New-SandboxEnvironment {
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [string]$UserId,
        
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)]
        [hashtable]$Configuration = @{}
    )
}

# Include comment-based help
function Test-Authorization {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Tests user authorization for specific actions.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    Validates that a user token has permission to perform a specific operation
    within the security framework.
    #>
}
```

#### Error Handling
```powershell
# Always use proper error handling
try {
    $result = Invoke-SecurityOperation
    return $result
} catch {
    Write-Error "Security operation failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    throw
}
```

#### Security Considerations
- **Never hardcode** secrets or credentials
- **Always validate** user input and parameters
- **Use encryption** for sensitive data storage
- **Log security events** appropriately
- **Follow least privilege** principles

### Testing Requirements
- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Tests must pass on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Security features require additional security testing

## üîí Security Guidelines

### Reporting Security Issues
**Please report security vulnerabilities responsibly:**

1. **Do NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email security issues** privately (if contact information available)
3. **Use the security issue template** for non-critical security concerns
4. **Allow reasonable time** for fixes before public disclosure

### Security Review Process
- All security-related changes require additional review
- Security modifications must be tested in isolated environments
- Changes affecting authentication/authorization need thorough validation

## üéØ Issue and PR Guidelines

### Creating Issues
Use our issue templates:
- **üêõ Bug Report** - For reporting issues
- **‚ú® Feature Request** - For suggesting improvements
- **üîí Security Vulnerability** - For security concerns

### Pull Request Process
1. **Update documentation** for any user-facing changes
2. **Add or update tests** as necessary
3. **Follow commit message conventions**
4. **Reference related issues** in your PR description
5. **Be prepared** to respond to review feedback
